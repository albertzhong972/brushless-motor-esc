# brushless-motor-esc

Finished schematic capture and board layout of the first prototype for my brushless motor electronic speed controller. Currently waiting to receive my PCB from JLCPCB. Currently, the PCB consists of the MOSFETs, MOSFET drivers, and back-EMF detection circuit. I will be pairing this PCB with a STM32G071 nucleo board for prototyping purposes. Future revisions of this ESC will include a microcontroller and be able to function by itself, similar to a commercially available ESC.
